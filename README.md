## ☁️ Optional Cloud Sync

By default, Unfold stores everything locally in `localStorage`.

To enable **cross-device sync**:

1. **Create a Supabase account** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. **Copy your project credentials** (URL, anon key)
3. **Update `supabase.js`** with your credentials
4. **Sign up in the app** with email/password
5. Data syncs automatically to Supabase PostgreSQL

If you turn off cloud sync, your local data persists forever.

## 📦 Development

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
# Outputs optimized files to dist/
```

### Serve Production Build

```bash
npm run preview
# Opens http://localhost:4173
```

### Modify Styles

All CSS is in `style.css`. CSS variables handle theming:

```css
:root {
  --bg: #ffffff;
  --text: #000000;
  --accent: #8b5cf6;
  /* ... */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --bg: #0f172a;
    --text: #ffffff;
    /* ... */
  }
}
```

Edit these to rebrand Unfold.

### Add New Journal Prompts

Open `app.js` and extend the `journalPrompts` array:

```javascript
const journalPrompts = [
  // Existing prompts...
  {
    framework: "Stoicism",
    prompt: "What is one thing outside your control today?"
  }
];
```
